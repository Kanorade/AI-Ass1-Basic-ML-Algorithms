Things to ask at help desk:

 - Is it fine to just copy and paste bits of code from helper-code.java?
 - Alternatively, can I edit helper-code.java to suit my needs and submit that too?
 - will the code be tested with other files. say, will perceptron be tested with class
 states other than 'g' and 'b'
